When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
iowa_roads <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dkjam5511/DS202FinalProjectDataset/master/HISTORIC_ROAD_CONDITIONS_data.csv")
iowa_roads
```

```{r}
